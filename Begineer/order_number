order_number is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the order ID and the customer ID.
 

Write an SQL query to find the customer_number for the customer who has placed the largest number of orders.

The test cases are generated so that exactly one customer will have placed more orders than any other customer.

SELECT 
    customer_number 
FROM
    Orders 
GROUP BY Customer_number  
ORDER BY count(customer_number) 
DESC limit 1
