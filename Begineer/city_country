SOLUTION - 

This query can be solved by inner join also but i tried it with Sub-query

SELECT 
    ct.name
FROM
    CITY ct
WHERE
    ct.COUNTRYCODE IN (
                        SELECT 
                            cu.CODE
                        FROM
                            COUNTRY cu
                        WHERE cu.CONTINENT = 'Africa'
                        )
